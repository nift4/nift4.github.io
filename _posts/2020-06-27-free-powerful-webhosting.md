# Free, powerful webhosting
Or: My new website setup

I now have 2 new domains: http://nift4.tk (GitHub Pages) and http://nift4.cf (HelioHost). HelioHost offers free, powerful webhosting and GutHub Pages offers open source webhosting. The best part: Both domains are free! I got them at http://freenom.com. Great, isn't it?
